//var ONLINE , var Online, var online -> different variables 
/* var 1_online  -> never start with numeric
a)If you want use the numeric then you can prefix the dollar sign before the numeric varaible decleration;
eg: var $1_online;
b)Mostly developer uses the camelcasing for the decelaring the variables 
for const , like never change the value or text in entire application/program the variable deceleration
will be in all capitals in general. 
i.e., const PI , const RADII ,  const BOLTMANN TEMP e.t.c
